Find here some data to test the commands given in the tutorial at the root of the repository.

`ALL_DATA_CSV.csv` and `ALL_DATA_JSON.json` are a light version of what you should get from the scripts of the repository.
You can in consequence **import these data in your Neo4j instance** without being forced to play all the tutorial.
