Here are some of the graphs you will be able to get in the Neo4j browser 
after importing your data inside the Neo4j database.

Graphs are cool because, first, it's art (eheh), and mostly, because it 
helps visualizing the data to find matches between data.

For example, the _Graph database system_ has been used to solve the 
"Panama Papers" case !
